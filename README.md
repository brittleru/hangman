# Hangman
This is the classic hangman game made in vanilla JS and the animation with svg in HTML. The svg is a simple one it has 4 lines for the hang and for the man it has one circle and 5 lines. At 6 mistakes it will be game over and if you press the same letter twice a popup that will last for 1.5 seconds and will show up to let you know that you already used it.
